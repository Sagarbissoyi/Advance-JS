Q)     What is object-oriented programming?
--->    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organises software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.




ex:-


const alien1 = {
    name: "Ali",
    species: "alien",
    phrase: () => console.log("I'm Ali the alien!"),
    fly: () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
}
const alien2 = {
    name: "Lien",
    species: "alien",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Run for your lives!"),
    fly: () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
}
const bug1 = {
    name: "Buggy",
    species: "bug",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Your debugger doesn't work with me!"),
    hide: () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
}


const bug2 = {
    name: "Erik",
    species: "bug",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("I drink decaf!"),
    hide: () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
}
const Robot1 = {
    name: "Tito",
    species: "robot",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("I can cook, swim and dance!"),
    transform: () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
}
const Robot2 = {
    name: "Terminator",
    species: "robot",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Hasta la vista, baby!"),
    transform: () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
}









-->  See that all characters have the name and species properties and also the sayPhrase method. Moreover, each species has a method that belongs only to that species (for example, aliens have the fly method).

-->  To solve this problem we need a programmatic way of creating objects and setting different properties and methods given a set of conditions. And that's what classes are good for. ðŸ˜‰











--->   Classes set a blueprint to create objects with predefined properties and methods. By creating a class, you can later on instantiate (create) objects from that class, that will inherit all the properties and methods that class has.








class Alien { // Name of the class
    // The constructor method will take a number of parameters and assign those parameters as properties to the created object.
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "alien"
    }
    // These will be the object's methods.
    fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Bug {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "bug"
    }
    hide = () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Robot {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "robot"
    }
    transform = () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}
//a constructor is a function which is used to initialize an object

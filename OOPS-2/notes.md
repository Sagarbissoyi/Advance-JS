 ///////////////// /NEW


--> The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.







lasses set a blueprint to create objects with predefined properties and methods. By creating a class, you can later on instantiate (create) objects from that class, that will inherit all the properties and methods that class has.
class Alien { // Name of the class
    // The constructor method will take a number of parameters and assign those parameters as properties to the created object.
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "alien"
    }
    // These will be the object's methods.
    fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Bug {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "bug"
    }
    hide = () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Robot {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "robot"
    }
    transform = () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}
//a constructor is a function which is used to initialize an object
new
The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

Now we can make objects using these classes.
const alien1 = new Alien("Ali", "I'm Ali the alien!")
// We use the "new" keyword followed by the corresponding class name
// and pass it the corresponding parameters according to what was declared in the class constructor function
const alien2 = new Alien("Lien", "Run for your lives!")
const bug1 = new Bug("Buggy", "Your debugger doesn't work with me!")
const bug2 = new Bug("Erik", "I drink decaf!")
const Robot1 = new Robot("Tito", "I can cook, swim and dance!")
const Robot2 = new Robot("Terminator", "Hasta la vista, baby!")





////////   What is object-oriented programming?


-->   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organises software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.

Creating Objects:-.
A way of creating our characters could be to just manually create the objects using object literals, in this way:


const alien1 = {
    name: "Ali",
    species: "alien",
    phrase: () => console.log("I'm Ali the alien!"),
    fly: () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
}
const alien2 = {
    name: "Lien",
    species: "alien",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Run for your lives!"),
    fly: () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
}
const bug1 = {
    name: "Buggy",
    species: "bug",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Your debugger doesn't work with me!"),
    hide: () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
}






const bug2 = {
    name: "Erik",
    species: "bug",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("I drink decaf!"),
    hide: () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
}
const Robot1 = {
    name: "Tito",
    species: "robot",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("I can cook, swim and dance!"),
    transform: () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
}
const Robot2 = {
    name: "Terminator",
    species: "robot",
    sayPhrase: () => console.log("Hasta la vista, baby!"),
    transform: () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
}


See that all characters have the name and species properties and also the sayPhrase method. Moreover, each species has a method that belongs only to that species (for example, aliens have the fly method).

To solve this problem we need a programmatic way of creating objects and setting different properties and methods given a set of conditions. And that's what classes are good for. ðŸ˜‰
Classes set a blueprint to create objects with predefined properties and methods. By creating a class, you can later on instantiate (create) objects from that class, that will inherit all the properties and methods that class has.
class Alien { // Name of the class
    // The constructor method will take a number of parameters and assign those parameters as properties to the created object.
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "alien"
    }
    // These will be the object's methods.
    fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Bug {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "bug"
    }
    hide = () => console.log("You can't catch me now!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

class Robot {
    constructor (name, phrase) {
        this.name = name
        this.phrase = phrase
        this.species = "robot"
    }
    transform = () => console.log("Optimus prime!")
    sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase)
}

Static Variables / methods
Static method are declared and allocated memory only once. All the objects share these static properties.
The static keyword defines static methods for classes.
Static methods are called directly on the class (Car from the example above) - without creating an instance/object (mycar) of the class.

--> A piece of code called polyfill is used to add support for more recent features in earlier browsers that don't already have native support for them.


--> For instance, let's say ðŸ’­ that as part of their language iteration, JavaScript releases a new function, let's say x. Now, this feature might not be supported by all older browsers. However, as developers, we would prefer that our apps function across all browsers. Using bespoke code, polyfills assist us in making this achievable.
